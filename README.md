## Installation

We have an install script `automate_steps.sh` to provision VMs, install mikrok8s, and deploy our use case application. The Script is located under `install-scripts/microk8s`.  
The following steps are required to execute the script from you local machine:

1. Terraform and Ansilbe installed
2. service-account.json in provisioning folder, in google cloud console go to IAM & Verwaltung > Dienstkonten > Dienstkonto erstellen > Zugriff Standartt/Inhaber. After generating the Service Account click on the Service Account > Schlüssel and generate a new Key. Copy the key to the service-account.json file.
3. Create (or use an existing) Key Pair, and place it under Compute Engine > Metadaten > SSH-Schlüssel > bearbeiten.
4. In the ansible inventory file you will need your user name for the connection. Go to provisioning/inventory.tmpl and change it.
5. If your key file is not at the default location `~/.ssh/id_rsa` you will need to provide the exact location and add this `--key-file "~/.ssh/mykey.pem"` whenever you run `ansible-playbook` in `automate_steps.sh`.

If you have completed all this steps execute the script from `install-scripts/microk8s`.

## Forking

The project is designed to run the benchmarks through our pre-configured github action workflow which is defined in `.github/workflows/terraform.yml`

### 1. GCloud Setup

1. Enable the Compute Engine API: https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/compute.googleapis.com/overview
2. Create your Service Account: https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts/
3. Create and download a JSON key for your Service Account (**Actions** > **Manage Keys** > **Add Key**)

### 2. ENV Preparation

Define the following secrets in **Settings** > **Secrets** > **Repository secrets**:

- `PRIVATE_KEY`
- `PUBLIC_KEY`
- `GCE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`: The contents of your GCloud service account JSON file.

:warning: Make sure the Service Account has sufficient access to your project. E.g. we have chosen the **Owner** role.

For now you also have to change some Terraform variables inside the files therefore open the **_install-scripts/provisioning/tfvars.json_** and edit the following values:

- `gcp_project_id`: The id of your google cloud project

### 3. Run the Action

To run the action in your own repository:

1. Go to the "**Actions**" tab
2. Select the "**Install Edge Orchestrator**" workflow on the left
3. Hit "**Run workflow**" on top of the list of runs

If you get an error regarding failed artifacts download, try to run the workflow again.

### 4. Destroy the Environment

The **Install Edge Orchestrator** workflow does not destroy the environment after a run to speed up the action on subsequent runs. If you need a clean environment use you have to destroy the previous environment with the **Destroy Environment** action. To run the action in your own repository:

1. Go to the "**Actions**" tab
2. Select the "**Destroy Environment**" workflow on the left
3. Hit "**Run workflow**" on top of the list of runs
